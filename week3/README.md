### Learning Activities & Resources
I took many WordPress courses on YouTube and bilibili to help me understand.
Shifting to WordPress, I utilized plugins like "Map Press" for interactive maps, "WP Form" for forms, and "Spectra" for advanced functionalities, along with the "Astra" theme for its sophisticated and adaptable design. 
In terms of map plug-ins, I searched a lot of resources but were limited by the need to pay, and finally found "MapPress"This was a valuable learning experience in understanding and working within technical constraints.
In choosing the right theme for the WordPress site aimed at the 30-60 age group, I considered "Blocksy," "Neve," and "Astra." "Blocksy" offers a modern feel with dynamic layout options, while "Neve" is known for its speed and lightweight structure, making it highly responsive. However, "Astra" was the final choice due to its perfect blend of sophistication and ease of customization. Its professional layouts and robust design options made it more suitable for our mature audience, offering an optimal balance of aesthetics and functionality.

Adapting "Brewed Bliss" to a different age group with WordPress honed my skills in audience analysis and web design versatility. It highlighted the importance of CMS flexibility and the ability to customize content to suit diverse user groups, a valuable skill in web development and digital marketing.

### Personal Insights from Group Formation Interviews

The 'job interview' style interaction with my classmates was an interesting way to understand how different individuals approach group projects and what skills they bring to the table.

- Diverse Skills and Perspectives: One of the things that stood out to me was the wide variety of skills and work styles that everyone has. Some people are more technically inclined, especially with WordPress, while others have strengths in organization or creativity.
- Communication Styles: The informal interview setting allowed us to communicate more openly. It was simpler to predict how possible team members would respond to pressure and communicate their ideas. It also emphasized how crucial clear communication is when working in a group.
- Compatibility and team dynamics: These interviews are not only about finding the most skilled individuals, but also about identifying those who fit well into the team dynamics. It is clear that the ability to respect each other and work harmoniously is just as important as technical skills.
- Personal Learning: On a personal level, this experience has been enlightening. It made me realize how important it is to have an open mind and be flexible when working in a group. A successful group project requires understanding and respecting the diverse perspectives and work habits of its members.
