### Week 1

#### Learning Activities & Resources
 - This week, I developed the concept for a website based on our theme, an artisanal coffee subscription service. As my knowledge of HTML and CSS was limited, I found some excellent tutorials on YouTube and the Chinese website Bilibili that helped me quickly grasp these languages.

#### Estimated Hours
I spent 6 hours of my own time on this practical.

#### Content Insights

HTML and CSS are the foundational languages of web design. This time, 
I chose to write the code myself instead of using ready-made templates like Bootstrap. 
I believe understanding templates is one thing, but applying them can be challenging. 
Writing my code and troubleshooting helped me gain a deeper understanding of code structure and management. 
I opted for a single-page design with multiple sections and used "id" for clickable navigation, but found it only allowed the target area to top-align, 
not center. I learned that achieving a centered effect requires combining CSS and JavaScript, which I omitted for now as the focus was more on design concepts. 
In CSS, I used responsive design syntax "@media" to adapt to different display devices and realized that on smaller screens, 
the top navigation bar was incomplete, so I added a "menu" button as an alternative, also skipping the CSS and JavaScript for expanding this button.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I recognized that the key to this practical exercise was understanding the web design approach: 
how to make users quickly and intuitively understand my startup business. Having no prior experience in this area, 
I referenced many excellent websites, such as Apple, learning from their layout and design. While I did not delve deeply 
into the functionality of the code, which is typically the domain of front-end developers, as a student with aspirations to become a back-end engineer, 
I realized the importance of design thinking.Nowadays, many low-code tools enable even those with minimal coding skills to create moderately functional websites. 
Moreover, I realized the importance of combining theory with practice. Before actually getting hands-on, understanding gained from watching educational resources is limited.
