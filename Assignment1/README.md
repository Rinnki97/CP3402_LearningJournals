### Learning Activities & Resources
I took many WordPress courses on YouTube and bilibili to help me understand.
Shifting to WordPress, I utilized plugins like "Map Press" for interactive maps, "WP Form" for forms, and "Spectra" for advanced functionalities, along with the "Astra" theme for its sophisticated and adaptable design. 
In terms of map plug-ins, I searched a lot of resources but were limited by the need to pay, and finally found "MapPress"This was a valuable learning experience in understanding and working within technical constraints.
In choosing the right theme for the WordPress site aimed at the 30-60 age group, I considered "Blocksy," "Neve," and "Astra." "Blocksy" offers a modern feel with dynamic layout options, while "Neve" is known for its speed and lightweight structure, making it highly responsive. However, "Astra" was the final choice due to its perfect blend of sophistication and ease of customization. Its professional layouts and robust design options made it more suitable for our mature audience, offering an optimal balance of aesthetics and functionality.
