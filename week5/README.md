This week's practical session focused on making at least six visible customizations to our website's style. Embracing this task, I've implemented several aesthetic updates to enhance user interaction and the visual hierarchy of the content.

### Learning Activities & Resources
- Enqueuing the Child Theme Stylesheet: 
A pivotal step in the customization process was the creation of a functions.php file within my child theme. This file serves as a direct channel to enqueue the child theme's style.css, ensuring that all the stylings are properly loaded on top of the parent theme. 

Here's an overview of the modifications I made:
- Warm Beige Background: The website's body now sports a warm beige background (background-color: #eae2d6), replacing the default color. 
- Deep Blue Active Links: I've changed the default link color to a deep blue (color: #1452a7). This shade not only enhances readability against the light background but also complements the overall color scheme
- Bright Hover Effect: To make interactions more intuitive, links now transition to a bright sandy color on hover (color: #f4a261). 
- Enhanced Font Size: The medium font size has been upscale (--wp--preset--font-size--medium: 1.5rem), ensuring that the text is more legible and comfortable to read
- Contrasting Text on Background Blocks: To further enhance text readability on colored background blocks, I've implemented a contrasting color (color: #ffa0a0). 
- Distinctive Button Styling: The block buttons received a significant revamp with a new background color (background-color: #eca0a2) and increased border-radius (border-radius: 20px).
- Bold Post Titles: The post titles have been given a weighty presence (font-weight: 1000)
