## Learning Journal for Week7

### Learning Activities & Resources
The week involved enhancing basic PHP files like header.php, footer.php, and front-page.php for a WordPress theme. We also created a functions.php file to link CSS and JavaScript.

The key PHP features we focused on were:

- Echoing different kinds of HTML
- Implementing if/else statements (Decisions)
- Demonstrating repetition using for, while, and foreach loops
- Writing and using functions with parameters
- Using include to integrate a common header and footer

For styling, we wrote CSS to give the front-page.php a professional appearance. I also search for the resources of how to link JavaScript and CSS in WordPress themes using 'wp_register_style' and 'wp-register_script'
