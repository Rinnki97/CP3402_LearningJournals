## Content Explanation

For my second practical, I developed "Brewed Bliss" targeting young audiences, which is different from practical 1. Using Joomla, the website presents a clear, user-friendly interface that aligns with the visual preferences of younger users. "Brewed Bliss" features a range of content centered on artisanal coffee, including detailed descriptions of coffee varieties, brewing methods, and subscription options. The site combines practical information with a modern design, aiming to engage and educate young coffee enthusiasts about the artisanal coffee culture.

## Learning Journal for Week 2

### Learning Activities & Resources

In Week 2, I advanced my skills in Joomla, focusing on a more modern design approach compared to my Week 1 project. I used YouTube tutorials extensively to understand Joomla's capabilities and challenges. During this process, I employed the 'gridbox' plugin for its user-friendly features and design flexibility. However, I later realized that such plugins might not be permissible in future assignments. Despite this, I believe that using 'gridbox' enhanced our website's appeal, offering intuitive design tools and a range of customization options.

#### Estimated Hours
I started creating the first joomla page on the evening of November 23, 2023, and then started learning according to the YouTube tutorial, which took about 2 days. After that, I learned about gridbox and spent about 3 days on and off to improve the entire website.
It took about 5 and a half days in total.

### Content Insights

The website's design reflects a modern and visually appealing layout, specifically catering to the preferences of younger users. The use of Joomla as a CMS, complemented by 'gridbox,' allowed for a more flexible and creative design approach. My understanding of the target audience's preferences deepened, highlighting the importance of aligning content and design with user expectations.
