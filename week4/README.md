### Learning Activities & Resources
Following the tutorial on the tutorial course, I chose XAMPP as my local development environment. It has comprehensive package, which includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. Additionally, XAMPP's widespread use and strong community support provided assurance of reliability and accessibility of resources for troubleshooting.

About 2 hours

### Content Insights
While exploring options for local development environments, I considered alternatives like WAMP and Docker. WAMP is popular choice, especially for Windows users, but I found XAMPP to offer a more intuitive user experience.
Docker, while extremely powerful and versatile, has a steeper learning curve and is more suited for complex development needs, which was more than I required for this project.
Ultimately, XAMPP's cross-platform flexibility and straightforward setup process made it the most suitable option for my current requirements.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Setting up a local development environment has been a significant learning curve. It has provided me with the flexibility to experiment with WordPress features without the constraints of an online environment. I plan to explore deploying the local WordPress site to a live server, which will be an essential skill for my web development journey.
